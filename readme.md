# Introduction

Development on XNACPC was borne out of an interest to test the constraints of C# and XNA. I was curious as to how much CPU power you could get out of the Xbox 360 platform with C#, since in some other experiments I was worried it was a little limited. I also wanted to see how well you could structure an emulator with the language features of C#. To make the source code easy to understand and navigate, which is something you can't say about most C++ based emulators.

An Amstrad emulator is something I've toyed with since 1998, when I worked on a similarly experimental project. I managed to get it to a working state back then, and included it in my portfolio when I was attempting to get into the games industry. It's still available for download here: http://www.angelfire.com/retro2/cpc3d/

When working on XNACPC I started from scratch again. I used my old source code as a reference, as well as various Amstrad technical documentation. I made a point of not looking at any existing 'fully-featured' CPC emulators source code. I didn't want to take the fun and experimentation out of the project.

XNACPC as it stands now, is comparable to some of the late 90's CPC emulators. It's got a very good rate of compatibility with games I've tried on it; probably around 9 out of 10 worked perfectly for me. I've played through many games with it now, it makes a really fun platform to play CPC games on an Xbox 360.

It's by no means striving to be a competitor to the raft of full-featured PC- based emulators around now. It's just a humble toy project that I wanted to share. Unfortunately due to the obvious legal issues around distributing games I don't have the rights for, I can't upload it to the Xbox Live Indie Games service. So you'll need the XNA Creators Club subscription to be able to use the emulator on your Xbox 360.
