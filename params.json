{"name":"XNACPC","tagline":"XNACPC is an Amstrad CPC emulator for the Xbox 360 and PC, written using C# and XNA.","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nDevelopment on XNACPC was borne out of an interest to test the constraints of C# and XNA. I was curious as to how much CPU power you could get out of the Xbox 360 platform with C#, since in some other experiments I was worried it was a little limited. I also wanted to see how well you could structure an emulator with the language features of C#. To make the source code easy to understand and navigate, which is something you can't say about most C++ based emulators.\r\n\r\nAn Amstrad emulator is something I've toyed with since 1998, when I worked on a similarly experimental project. I managed to get it to a working state back then, and included it in my portfolio when I was attempting to get into the games industry. It's still available for download here: http://www.angelfire.com/retro2/cpc3d/\r\n\r\nWhen working on XNACPC I started from scratch again. I used my old source code as a reference, as well as various Amstrad technical documentation. I made a point of not looking at any existing 'fully-featured' CPC emulators source code. I didn't want to take the fun and experimentation out of the project.\r\n\r\nXNACPC as it stands now, is comparable to some of the late 90's CPC emulators. It's got a very good rate of compatibility with games I've tried on it; probably around 9 out of 10 worked perfectly for me. I've played through many games with it now, it makes a really fun platform to play CPC games on an Xbox 360.\r\n\r\nIt's by no means striving to be a competitor to the raft of full-featured PC- based emulators around now. It's just a humble toy project that I wanted to share. Unfortunately due to the obvious legal issues around distributing games I don't have the rights for, I can't upload it to the Xbox Live Indie Games service. So you'll need the XNA Creators Club subscription to be able to use the emulator on your Xbox 360.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Blog Posts\r\n\r\nA couple of blog posts I've made about development of the emulator:\r\n* http://www.gavpugh.com/2010/05/21/xnacpc-an-amstrad-cpc-emulator-for-the-xbox-360/\r\n* http://www.gavpugh.com/2011/11/11/xnacpc-xbox-360-amstrad-cpc-emulator-released/\r\n\r\n\r\n# XNACPC In Action\r\n\r\nA demonstration video showing a number of games running on Xbox 360:\r\n[![XNACPC In Action](http://img.youtube.com/vi/TfB2V1DmFs0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfB2V1DmFs0)\r\n\r\n# Readme and Downloads\r\n\r\n## Repository/Readme\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/gavinpugh/xnacpc\r\n\r\n## PC Binary Package (ready to play)\r\n* http://www.gavpugh.com/xnacpc/xnacpc_1_0_pc_binaries.zip\r\n\r\n### Prereqs\r\n\r\nMicrosoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0\r\n* http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20914\r\n\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4\r\n* http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718\r\n\r\n## Xbox 360 Source Package (ready to deploy)\r\n\r\n* http://www.gavpugh.com/xnacpc/xnacpc_1_0_source.zip\r\n\r\n### Prereqs\r\n\r\nMicrosoft XNA Game Studio 4.0\r\n* http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=23714\r\n","google":"UA-26956252-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
